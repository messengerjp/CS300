# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- This course focused on different types of data structures and the benefits and drawbacks of each structure. We would create different data structures like Binary Search Trees, Arrays, and Hash Tables, and learn the correct uses case for each structure. We would use our understanding of these different structures to select one to implement with ABC University's course list. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- I would try to visualize the data structures in my help me understand what my code needed to do. In addition, visualization helped me understand concepts like hashing which I had never implemented into code before. Manipulating large amounts of data can be demanding on machines which will lead to longer runtimes for programs. On a small scale this may not cause significant issues, however implemenmting the correct data structure can increase run time on larger projects. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
- I work for a Payroll Company and have begun implementing these structures into my spreadsheets at work to more efficiently process data. I love learning new coding practices, and I already know that being able to efficiently work with data through these structures will help drastically. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- Being able to implement these data structures will lessen the run times of my programs, as well as, allowing me to easily access and edit my data. I also will be able to avoid spaghetti code, as I now have a clear code base to use when using these structures in my own code.
